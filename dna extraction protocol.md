## Before you begin
1. Before first use of the kit: prepare S5—Wash Buffer
Add 13 mL of 96–100% ethanol to S5—Wash Buffer Concentrate ,
mix well, and store at room temperature.
2. If precipitate is visible in S1—Lysis Buffer or S4—Binding buffer,
warm the buffers at 37°C for 5 minutes and shake well to dissolve
the precipitate.

## step 1 - Prepare the lysate
**a.** Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes to pellet the microorganisms.

Samples larger than 5 mL may require longer centrifugation times for optimal recovery of microorganisms.

Use an appropriately sized centrifuge tube; do not use a Bead Tube.

**b.** Carefully remove the supernatant and discard.

Avoid disturbing the microbial pellet during this step. Loss of pellet will result in decreased
yield.

**c.** Resuspend the microbial pellet in 800 µL of S1—Lysis buffer, pipet up and down or vortex to resuspend, then transfer the sample to the Bead Tube.

**d.** Add 100 µL of S2—Lysis Enhancer, cap securely, and vortex briefly.

**e.** Incubate at 65°C for 10 minutes.

**f.** Homogenize by bead beating for 10 minutes at maximum speed on the vortex mixer.

Use the hands-free adapter and horizontal agitation.

**g.** Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 2 minutes.

**h.** Transfer up to 500 µL of the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf tube), avoiding the bead pellet
and any debris.
## step 2 - Bind the DNA to the column 
**a.** Add 900 µL of S4—Binding buffer, and vortex briefly.

**b.** Load 700 µL of the sample mixture onto a spin column-tube assembly, and centrifuge at14,000 × g for 1 minute.

**c.** Discard the flow-through and repeat step 2b with the remaining sample mixture.
## step 3 - Wash and elute the DNA
**a.** Place the spin column in a clean collection tube, add 500 µL of S5—Wash buffer, then centrifuge the spin column-tube assembly at 14,000 × g for 1 minute.

**b.** Discard the flow-through then centrifuge the spin column-tube assembly at 14,000 × g for 30 seconds.

The second centrifugation optimizes removal of S5—Wash buffer, which could interfere with downstream applications.

**c.** Place the spin column in a clean tube, add 100 µL of S6—Elution buffer, then incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.

**d.** Centrifuge the spin column-tube assembly at 14,000 × g for 1 minute, then discard the column.
The purified DNA is in the tube

The DNA is ready for immediate use. Alternatively, store the purified DNA:

- At 4°C for up to 1 week.
- At –20°C for long-term storage.

I need to highlight these ==S1,S2,S3,S4,S5,S6==.
