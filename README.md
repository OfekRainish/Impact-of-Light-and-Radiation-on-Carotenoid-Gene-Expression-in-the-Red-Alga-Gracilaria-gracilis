### Overview

Global warming is significantly impacting marine ecosystems by raising water temperatures, increasing acidity, and intensifying UV radiation, all of which pose serious challenges to marine organisms, particularly macroalgae. *Gracilaria gracilis*, a red alga found along Israel's Mediterranean coast, plays a vital role in its ecosystem. As a primary producer, it supports marine life and is also commercially valuable for its bioactive compounds.

Carotenoids, pigments crucial for photosynthesis, also protect algae from light-induced stress. They help absorb excess light and neutralize harmful free radicals, thus safeguarding the photosynthetic machinery. In the context of global warming, which is expected to increase UVB radiation and alter light intensity, understanding how *G. gracilis* modulates carotenoid production is essential for predicting its resilience and adaptability.

Our study aims to investigate the impact of varying light intensities and UV radiation on carotenoid gene expression in *G. gracilis*, simulating current and future climate scenarios. We will expose the algae to low, medium, and high light and UV levels over six weeks, mimicking natural day-night cycles. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with 16S rRNA as a reference gene, we will measure changes in carotenoid gene expression. This research will provide insights into how *G. gracilis* responds to environmental stressors linked to climate change and offer guidance for optimizing its commercial cultivation to produce high-value carotenoids.

### Methods

1. **Algae Collection**: Samples of *G. gracilis* will be collected from the Israeli Mediterranean coast, ensuring consistent sampling times to reduce variability. After rinsing, samples will be placed in aerated seawater aquaria.

2. **Cultivation Under Controlled Conditions**: 
   - Multiple aquaria will be set up with varying light intensities and UV radiation levels, using LED lights and UVB lamps. A control group will be included, with all other environmental factors (temperature, salinity, nutrients) held constant.
   - Samples will be collected after 2, 4, and 6 weeks to observe the effects over time.

3. **Gene Identification**: 
   - Carotenoid biosynthesis genes will be identified using public databases such as NCBI. BLAST will be used to find homologous genes in *G. gracilis*, and specific primers will be designed using Primer3. PCR validation will confirm the primers' specificity.

4. **Gene Expression Quantification**: 
   - RNA extraction will be performed, and quality will be checked with NanoDrop and gel electrophoresis. RNA will then be reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and qPCR will be conducted using the 16S gene for normalization. Data will be statistically analyzed to identify significant differences in gene expression across treatment groups.

### Impact

This research will elucidate *G. gracilis*'s adaptive mechanisms through carotenoid gene expression in response to varying light and radiation levels, enhancing our understanding of macroalgae resilience to climate change. Furthermore, it will provide critical insights for the commercial cultivation of *G. gracilis* for high-value carotenoid production, contributing to the sustainable development of coastal ecosystems and the blue economy.
